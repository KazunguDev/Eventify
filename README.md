The problem statement is to develop a system that utilizes QR codes to register people to an event and track their attendance using location based tracking. The system will send event related information only to those who are online and in the location of the event. Additionally the system will allow for real time feedback collection from the attendees in the event. The system will also allow for pre-processing by identifying individuals who are absent for more than 3 events and block them from future events.
